Package used:

1. turtlebot_gazebo package(path: src/turtlebot_simulator):
	 With the turtlebot_world.launch, we can deploy a turtlebot in a gazebo environment by linking the world file to it.
     With the amcl_demo.launch, we can serve the map and perform the localization. 
2. turtlebot_rviz_launchers:
     With the view_navigation_with_marker.launch file, we can load a preconfigured rviz workspace. This is a modified version of view_navigation.launch, which loads the rviz with            markers by default.
     It will automatically load the robot model, trajectories, and map. It will also performs the navigation.
3. turtlebot_teleop:
     With the keyboard_teleop.launch file, we can control the robot through the keyboard command.
